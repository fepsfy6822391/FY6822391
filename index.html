    The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the economies of many countries around the world. One significant consequence of the pandemic is the dramatic increase in the price of commodities in various countries, leading to a surge in the inflation rate. This surge in inflation, in turn, has driven up the cost of living, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to meet their basic needs. Additionally, many people have lost their jobs due to the decline in economic activities, such as production, leading to a rise in the unemployment rate and significant hardships for many.

  <p>
    Fortunately, governments and financial institutions have responded with new economic policies, such as adjusting interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment in the economy, gradually revitalizing business activities. This has had a positive impact, creating new jobs and enabling people to regain a decent standard of living. However, despite these efforts, inflation rates remain high, with the prices of goods and services often outpacing wage growth. Consequently, many individuals find themselves needing multiple sources of income to maintain a reasonable quality of life.

    Among the younger generation, these additional income sources are often referred to as "side hustles." Presently, one of the most well-known side hustles is virtual asset trading, defined as "the buying and selling of securities, such as the purchase of stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)" by Investopedia.

    However, one major risk associated with using a trading bot is that it usually bases its algorithm on historical data and past performance. Although historical data is helpful for making trading decisions, it may not always be applicable to the present market conditions, especially when there are major economic news events, such as Federal Reserve meetings. Therefore, traders should always remember that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and there is no strategy that has a 100% success rate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, traders typically need to use a virtual private server to ensure access to current market data or price movements. Any disruption in the technical setup might prevent the bot from functioning and, consequently, stop trading activities. As a result, individuals could miss out on potential profit margins or even lose a portion of their capital.

    In conclusion, the decision to use trading bots or not depends on the individual and their objectives. Trading bots have the potential to help people generate a passive income while providing a sense of 'freedom.' However, the downsides associated with bots can be mitigated by risking a lower percentage of capital and thoroughly researching and back-testing the bot using a demo account before using it with real money.
