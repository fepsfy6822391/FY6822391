    The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the economies of many countries around the world. One significant consequence of the pandemic is the dramatic increase in the price of commodities in various countries, leading to a surge in the inflation rate. This surge in inflation, in turn, has driven up the cost of living, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to meet their basic needs. Additionally, many people have lost their jobs due to the decline in economic activities, such as production, leading to a rise in the unemployment rate and significant hardships for many.

    Fortunately, governments and financial institutions have responded with new economic policies, such as adjusting interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment in the economy, gradually revitalizing business activities. This has had a positive impact, creating new jobs and enabling people to regain a decent standard of living. However, despite these efforts, inflation rates remain high, with the prices of goods and services often outpacing wage growth. Consequently, many individuals find themselves needing multiple sources of income to maintain a reasonable quality of life.
