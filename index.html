  <h1>The Era of “Traders”: How the new-gen is generating an Income</h1>
  <h2>Student URN 687834</h2>

  <p id="covid_impact">
    The economic effects of COVID-19 are examined in this article, with a focus on increasing inflation and unemployment. The younger generation goes to virtual asset trading during recovery attempts, particularly through "side hustles." This article examines technical and fundamental analysis, with a focus on the function of trading bots. These bots provide advantages like financial independence and dispassionate decision-making by using artificial intelligence to execute trades quickly. Risks are recognised, though, and include dependence on past data and disruption vulnerability. The conclusion urges people to engage cautiously, recommending that they limit capital risk and do extensive study. The article emphasises how trading bots have a revolutionary impact on adjusting to the post-pandemic economic environment.

  <p id="the_present">
    The COVID-19 pandemic has hugely affected the economy of many countries around the world. One significant impact of COVID-19 is how it drastically increased the price of commodities in countries, leading to a surge in the inflation rate. As a result, the cost of living increased, and many individuals struggled to survive, barely able to satisfy their basic needs. In addition, many lost their jobs due to a fall in economic activities such as production, which indeed raised the unemployment rate and made their life miserable.

    Fortunately, with new economic policies such as adjusting the interest rate to encourage individuals to borrow and invest in the economy to gradually increase business activities once again. This indeed had a positive impact on the country by creating new jobs and enabling people to retrieve a decent standard of living. However, the inflation rate remains high with goods and services being sold at a very high rate in comparison to the wage rate. Thus, many must carry out two jobs to maintain a reasonable quality of life. Amongst youngers, those extra hours of work are known as a “side hustle.” Presently, the most known side hustle is known as Virtual asset trading; “Refers to the buying and selling of securities, such as the purchase of stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).” (Investopedia.com).
