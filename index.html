  <h3>Abstract</h3>

  <p id="covid_impact">
    The economic effects of COVID-19 are examined in this article, with a focus on increasing inflation and unemployment. The younger generation goes to virtual asset trading during recovery attempts, particularly through "side hustles." This article examines technical and fundamental analysis, with a focus on the function of trading bots. These bots provide advantages like financial independence and dispassionate decision-making by using artificial intelligence to execute trades quickly. Risks are recognised, though, and include dependence on past data and disruption vulnerability. The conclusion urges people to engage cautiously, recommending that they limit capital risk and do extensive study. The article emphasises how trading bots have a revolutionary impact on adjusting to the post-pandemic economic environment.

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p id="the_present">
    The COVID-19 pandemic has hugely affected the economy of many countries around the world. One significant impact of COVID-19 is how it drastically increased the price of commodities in countries, leading to a surge in the inflation rate. As a result, the cost of living increased, and many individuals struggled to survive, barely able to satisfy their basic needs. In addition, many lost their jobs due to a fall in economic activities such as production, which indeed raised the unemployment rate and made their life miserable.
  </p>



  <p id="advantages_of_usage">
    Fortunately, with new economic policies such as adjusting the interest rate to encourage individuals to borrow and invest in the economy to gradually increase business activities once again. This indeed had a positive impact on the country by creating new jobs and enabling people to retrieve a decent standard of living. However, the inflation rate remains high with goods and services being sold at a very high rate in comparison to the wage rate. Thus, many must carry out two jobs to maintain a reasonable quality of life. Amongst youngers, those extra hours of work are known as a “side hustle.” Presently, the most known side hustle is known as Virtual asset trading; “Refers to the buying and selling of securities, such as the purchase of stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).” (Investopedia.com).

  <p>
    The greater accessibility that virtual asset trading offers to people who do not have strong financial backgrounds is one obvious benefit, especially when trading bots are used. A thorough grasp of intricate financial instruments and market dynamics is frequently necessary to participate in traditional financial markets. However, even people without a formal degree in finance can engage in virtual asset trading because of user-friendly interfaces and the automation offered by trading bots. The financial markets have become more accessible to a wider spectrum of people, enabling them to investigate investment opportunities and maybe make money.

  <h3>Advantages</h3>
  <p>
    By using advanced tools such as trading bots, it has enabled individuals to quickly execute especially in high volatile markets such as cryptocurrency. These bots operate at a staggering pace which indeed enables them to execute trades virtually instantaneously. Since bots are emotionless unlike human beings, emotional bias is avoided which could negatively affect judgments during speculation. This means that they are “immune to the euphoria of a winning streak or the panic of a downturn, ensuring a consistently rational approach.” (sciencetimes.com). Trading bots have also given stakeholders a sort of liberty since here the money works for them instead of them working for the money which indeed gives them financial and geographical freedom.

    <h3>Disadvantage</h3>
  <p>
    However, one major risk associated with using a trading bot is that it usually bases its algorithm on historical data and past performance. Indeed, historical data is helpful when it comes to making trading decisions, but it may sometimes not always be applicable to the present market condition, especially when there is major economic news such as the Federal Reserve general meeting. Henceforth, traders should always remember that past performance is not always indicative of the future, and, thus, there are no strategies that have a 100% success rate. Moreover, traders usually must use a virtual private server to ensure it has access to current market data or price movement. Therefore, any disruption in the technical setup might prevent the bot from function, and indeed stop trading activities. As a result, individuals would miss potential profit margins or even lose some part of their capital.

    Overall, when it comes to using trading bots or not depends on the individual and their objective. Trading bots indeed have a lot of potential in helping people generate a passive income while giving them ‘freedom’. On the other hand, the downturns associated with the bots can easily solve by risking a
