  <p>
    The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the economies of many countries around the world. One significant consequence of the pandemic is the dramatic increase in the price of commodities in various countries, leading to a surge in the inflation rate. This surge in inflation, in turn, has driven up the cost of living, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to meet their basic needs. Additionally, many people have lost their jobs due to the decline in economic activities, such as production, leading to a rise in the unemployment rate and significant hardships for many.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately, governments and financial institutions have responded with new economic policies, such as adjusting interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment in the economy, gradually revitalizing business activities. This has had a positive impact, creating new jobs and enabling people to regain a decent standard of living. However, despite these efforts, inflation rates remain high, with the prices of goods and services often outpacing wage growth. Consequently, many individuals find themselves needing multiple sources of income to maintain a reasonable quality of life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the younger generation, these additional income sources are often referred to as "side hustles." Presently, one of the most well-known side hustles is virtual asset trading, defined as "the buying and selling of securities, such as the purchase of stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)" by Investopedia.
  </p>

  <!-- Inserting the new paragraph -->
  <p>
    Participants in the side hustle of virtual asset trading are known as 'traders.' Traders can approach the financial market, where securities are bought and sold, from either a fundamental or technical point of view. Fundamental analysis involves analyzing economic data, while technical analysis involves observing the price movements of commodities. Technical analysis is most commonly used by active traders, those who buy, hold, and sell a security for a short period of time, typically less than a month, as defined by Investopedia. This technique can yield significant rewards but can also be risky if not carried out properly.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to the CFA Institute, "Technical analysis has three main principles: (1) The market discounts everything (price of a commodity falls at a point), (2) price move in trends and countertrends, and (3) price action is repetitive, with certain reoccurring pattern." Using these principles, some institutions have developed their own trading analogies and methodologies, incorporating modern tools such as Artificial Intelligence.
  </p>

  <p>
    One notable example of incorporating modern technology with technical analysis is trading bots. These bots are essentially software programs that use artificial intelligence to analyze the market and automatically execute virtual asset trades using a predefined algorithm.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using advanced tools such as trading bots, individuals can quickly execute trades, especially in high-volatility markets like cryptocurrencies. These bots operate at a staggering pace, enabling them to execute trades virtually instantaneously. Additionally, since bots lack human emotions, they avoid emotional biases that could negatively affect judgments during speculation. This means that they are "immune to the euphoria of a winning streak or the panic of a downturn, ensuring a consistently rational approach," as reported by Science Times. Furthermore, through trading bots, stakeholders can achieve a sense of financial and geographical freedom as their money works for them, rather than the other way around.
  </p>

  <!-- Adding the new paragraph -->
  <p>
    However, one major risk associated with using a trading bot is that it usually bases its algorithm on historical data and past performance. Although historical data is helpful for making trading decisions, it may not always be applicable to the present market conditions, especially when there are major economic news events, such as Federal Reserve meetings. Therefore, traders should always remember that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and there is no strategy that has a 100% success rate.
