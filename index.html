  <h3>Abstract</h3>

  <p id="covid_impact">
    The economic effects of COVID-19 are examined in this article, with a focus on increasing inflation and unemployment. The younger generation goes to virtual asset trading during recovery attempts, particularly through "side hustles." This article examines technical and fundamental analysis, with a focus on the function of trading bots. These bots provide advantages like financial independence and dispassionate decision-making by using artificial intelligence to execute trades quickly. Risks are recognised, though, and include dependence on past data and disruption vulnerability. The conclusion urges people to engage cautiously, recommending that they limit capital risk and do extensive study. The article emphasises how trading bots have a revolutionary impact on adjusting to the post-pandemic economic environment.
  </p>


  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p id="the_present">
    The COVID-19 pandemic has hugely affected the economy of many countries around the world. One significant impact of COVID-19 is how it drastically increased the price of commodities in countries, leading to a surge in the inflation rate. As a result, the cost of living increased, and many individuals struggled to survive, barely able to satisfy their basic needs. In addition, many lost their jobs due to a fall in economic activities such as production, which indeed raised the unemployment rate and made their life miserable.
  </p>
  <p id="advantages_of_usage">
    Fortunately, with new economic policies such as adjusting the interest rate to encourage individuals to borrow and invest in the economy to gradually increase business activities once again. This indeed had a positive impact on the country by creating new jobs and enabling people to retrieve a decent standard of living. However, the inflation rate remains high with goods and services being sold at a very high rate in comparison to the wage rate. Thus, many must carry out two jobs to maintain a reasonable quality of life. Amongst youngers, those extra hours of work are known as a “side hustle.” Presently, the most known side hustle is known as Virtual asset trading; “Refers to the buying and selling of securities, such as the purchase of stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).” (Investopedia.com).
  </p>
  <p>
   The participants of the side hustle of virtual asset trading are known as ‘traders’ and they each can approach the financial market (where securities are bought and sold) from either a fundamental point of view, analysing economic data, or through a technical one, meaning by observing the price movement of commodities. Technical analysis are most used by active traders, meaning those who buys, holds and sells a security for a short period of time (less than a month) (Investopedia).  This technique indeed generates a large reward but can also be risky if not carried out properly.  
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the CFA Institute, “Technical analysis has three main principles, (1) The market discount everything (price of commodity falls at a point), (2) price move in trends and countertrends, and (3) price action is repetitive, with certain reoccurring pattern” (figure 1). Using those principles some institution developed their own trading analogy and methodology by incorporating modern tools such as the Artificial Intelligent. 
  </p>
  <p>
   Trading bots is great example of incorporating modern technology with technical analysis. This is basically a software or program that use the artificial intelligent to analyse the market and automatically execute virtual asset trades using a predefined algorithm.  
  </p>

  <h3>Advantages</h3>
  <p>
    By using advanced tools such as trading bots, it has enabled individuals to quickly execute especially in high volatile markets such as cryptocurrency. These bots operate at a staggering pace which indeed enables them to execute trades virtually instantaneously. Since bots are emotionless unlike human beings, emotional bias is avoided which could negatively affect judgments during speculation. This means that they are “immune to the euphoria of a winning streak or the panic of a downturn, ensuring a consistently rational approach.” (sciencetimes.com). Trading bots have also given stakeholders a sort of liberty since here the money works for them instead of them working for the money which indeed gives them financial and geographical freedom.
  </p>
<p>
  The greater accessibility that virtual asset trading offers to people who do not have strong financial backgrounds is one obvious benefit, especially when trading bots are used. A thorough grasp of intricate financial instruments and market dynamics is frequently necessary to participate in traditional financial markets. However, even people without a formal degree in finance can engage in virtual asset trading because to user-friendly interfaces and the automation offered by trading bots. The financial markets have become more accessible to a wider spectrum of people, enabling them to investigate investment opportunities and maybe make money.
</p>
  
    <h3>Disadvantage</h3>
  <p>
    However, one major risk associated with using a trading bot is that it usually bases its algorithm on historical data and past performance. Indeed, historical data is helpful when it comes to making trading decisions, but it may sometimes not always be applicable to the present market condition, especially when there is major economic news such as the Federal Reserve general meeting. Henceforth, traders should always remember that past performance is not always indicative of the future, and, thus, there are no strategies that have a 100% success rate. Moreover, traders usually must use a virtual private server to ensure it has access to current market data or price movement. Therefore, any disruption in the technical setup might prevent the bot from function, and indeed stop trading activities. As a result, individuals would miss potential profit margins or even lose some part of their capital.
  </p>

  <p>
    The increased danger of security lapses and cyberattacks is a major drawback of trading virtual assets and using trading bots. Trading operations are moving more and more to digital platforms, which puts traders at risk for fraud, hacking, and other cybersecurity issues. If trading bots are not adequately secured, they may be used as targets by malicious actors. Cybercriminals can try to take advantage of software flaws or jeopardise trading account security. And for this reason, those who trade virtual assets need to give top priority to strong cybersecurity measures like two-factor authentication, safe internet connections, and frequent software upgrades in order to protect their money and private data from theft or unwanted access.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    
Overall, when it comes to using trading bots or not depends on the individual and their objective. Trading bots indeed has a lot of potential in helping people generate a passive income while giving them ‘freedom’. On the other hand, the downturns associate with the bots can easily solve by risking a lower percentage of capital and to thoroughly research and back test the bot using a demo account before using it with real money.
